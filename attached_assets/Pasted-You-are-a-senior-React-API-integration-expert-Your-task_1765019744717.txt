You are a senior React + API integration expert.

Your task:  
Scan **all files in the project** and confirm that UI/layout changes did NOT break, replace, overwrite, or fake ANY of the real API data coming from:

- IPify (public IP)
- IPInfo (location)
- Google OAuth user info
- Gmail scopes and security data (the new scopes we enabled)
- Any backend API endpoints in the project
- Any security/analytics APIs that calculate risk scores
- Any real-time API calls used in Dashboard, Scenario, Threat Detection, Events, and User Management pages

Perform ALL of the following operations:

---

## 🔍 1. Validate Every Data Source
Check every file for:
- Fake placeholder values that replaced real API values  
- Components that stopped receiving props after the UI refactor  
- Broken API calls  
- Data not being passed to cards/widgets  
- Data overwritten by blank state  
- `undefined`, `null`, or default fallback text that now shows after layout change  
- Any line where real data was replaced with mocked numbers  

---

## 🛠️ 2. Fix Any Issues Automatically
If you detect:
- A component using old variable names  
- A route not passing data  
- A hook not being triggered  
- A `useEffect` blocked by wrong dependencies  
- A card not receiving props because its wrapper changed  
- A state reset on page switch  
- Real API values being replaced with test values  

➡️ Fix them automatically.

Also fix:
- Z-index/layout issues that hide data visually  
- Any component that conditionally returns empty UI  
- Any broken imports after the refactor  
- Any file where you forgot to return the final rendered data  

---

## 🧪 3. Add Protection Checks
For ALL data-fetching components, ensure:
- There is a loading state  
- There is an error state  
- Real API data is clearly separated from placeholders  
- A fallback NEVER overwrites real data  
- No fake values appear unless explicitly set as demo mode  

---

## 🧭 4. End Result You Must Guarantee
“Switching pages, applying macOS glass UI, or changing layout MUST NOT cause:  
- Real API data to become fake  
- Real API data to stop rendering  
- API calls to silently fail  
- State to reset incorrectly  
- Data to vanish while changing tabs/routes”

---

## 📄 5. Final Deliverable
After scanning and fixing everything, output:

1. Exact files you inspected  
2. Files you modified  
3. Any data issues you found  
4. Confirmation that:
   - All real data flows correctly  
   - No API values were replaced  
   - All routes render complete data  
   - Layout changes did *not* break logic  

Now begin scanning all project files and fix issues.
